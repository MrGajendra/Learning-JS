console.log(`Hello, Gajendra Kumar`);
//This is how we print info in js but it is not a part of core js it is a window object 

//In Js for declaring value we use 
// const for constant
// let for variable
// var for variable (not recomended for Modern js )

//Examples 
const AccountID = 1234;
let AccountEmail = "gajendra@apple.com";
var AccountPassword = "1234";

AccountCity = "Korba";

// AccountID = 4321; (it is not allowed because it is a constant only variables value can be change )
